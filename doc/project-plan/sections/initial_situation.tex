\label{ch:initial_situation}

During the previous project a demonstrator was designed and built.
The demonstrator --- a throwing booth --- is constructed from aluminium profiles and consists of an industrial camera and proper lighting.
This demonstrator was used to collect a dataset that contains images of 22 different throwing objects.
The dataset is fully labeled and consists of more than \num{15000} usable images with at least 480 images of each object.

In this project, a convolutional neural network (CNN) model is developed and trained on a computer using the collected dataset.
This model is then implemented on an FPGA development board for a high-performance solution.
Since the throwing booth is used for demonstration purposes, the verification is an essential aspect of this project.
