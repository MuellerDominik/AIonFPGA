\chapter{Project Goal}
\label{ch:project_goal}

The goal of this project is to develop and train a CNN model and implement it on an FPGA development board.
Images of the throwing objects can then be captured by the camera, classified on the FPGA and displayed on the monitor.

The respective objectives for this project are specified in the following table:\\

\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{L{3.05cm}X}
  \toprule
  \textbf{Objective} & \textbf{Description} \\
  \midrule
  CNN Model & A CNN model is developed and trained on a computer. This is done in Python 3 using TensorFlow 2 and the previously collected dataset. \\
  \midrule
  High-Performance Implementation & The advantages of an FPGA flow into the development. Thus, special attention is paid to the performance of the system. \\
  \midrule
  Display & A monitor displays the image of the object that was thrown. Furthermore, the best guess of the CNN as well as additional statistics are shown. \\
  \midrule
  Verification & The accuracy and performance of the CNN model implemented on the FPGA is verified. These results are compared to the computer results. \\
