% Building a \acrlong{cnn} requires the design and training of a \acrshort{cnn} model.
Building a \acrlong{cnn} from scratch leaves a lot of design choices and requires multiple steps.
% In a first step, a \acrshort{cnn} architecture is designed and 
% The first step involves the design of the desired \acrshort{cnn} architecture and the tuning of the hyperparameters.
The first step involves the design of the desired \acrshort{cnn} architecture. % todo: remove desired?
In a second step, the labeled dataset is used to fit the \acrshort{cnn} model.
If necessary, the hyperparameters of the \acrshort{cnn} architecture can be tuned in a third step.

% This chapter describes these steps
This chapter describes the dataset generation, the design of the \acrshort{cnn} architecture and the actual training of the \acrshort{cnn} model. % todo: remove actual?
