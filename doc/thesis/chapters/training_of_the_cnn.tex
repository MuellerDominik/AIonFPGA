\chapter{Training of the CNN}
\label{ch:training_of_the_cnn}

Building a \acrlong{cnn} from scratch leaves a lot of design choices and requires multiple steps.
The first step involves the design of the desired \acrshort{cnn} architecture.
In a second step, the labeled dataset is used to fit the \acrshort{cnn} model.
If necessary, the hyperparameters of the \acrshort{cnn} architecture can be tuned in a third step.

This chapter describes the dataset generation, the design of the \acrshort{cnn} architecture and the actual training of the \acrshort{cnn} model.
