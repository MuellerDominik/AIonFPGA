In this project a VCXU-13C industrial camera from Baumer is used.
The Baumer company produces various sensors, such as CMOS sensors with different specifications.
The VCXU-13C camera features a global shutter.
Furthermore, it has a USB 3.0 interface for data transfer.
This is necessary because the Ultra96-V2 has no Ethernet interface.
The maximum frame rate of the camera is \SI{222}{fps}, which guarantees at least three pictures per throw.
The minimum exposure time is \SI{20}{\micro s} \cite{baumer_cam}.

The industrial camera requires a lens for proper operation.
Suitable for the camera is the lens ZVL-FL-HC0614-2M, which is also manufactured by Baumer.
The aperture is operated manually to focus the images.
