% The verification process is split into the two parts classification accuracy and throughput.
The verification process is divided into the two parts classification performance and throughput.
It ensures that all of the components perform as expected.

% The classification accuracy of the trained \acrshort{cnn} model is verified separately of the classification accuracy of the quantized model.
% The classification accuracy of the trained \acrshort{cnn} model is verified separately from that of the quantized model.
% Afterwards they are compared with each other.

% The throughput of the image classification chain is verified on the embedded system.

% This chapter describes the verification process of the classification performance and the throughput.
% Furthermore, it lists the results of the verification.

This chapter describes the verification process of the classification performance and the throughput of the \acrshort{cnn} models.
% While the classification performance is verified for the floating-point and quantized model, the throughput of the quantized model is only evaluated on the embedded system.
% On the one hand, the classification performance of the floating-point and quantized model is verified.
% On the one hand, the classification performance of the floating-point and quantized models are assessed.

On the other hand, only the throughput of the quantized model on the embedded system is evaluated.
% This evaluation is done on the embedded system.
% Furthermore, it lists the results of the verification.
Additionally, the results of the verification process are listed and compared.
