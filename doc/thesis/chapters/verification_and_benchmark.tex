\chapter{Verification}
\label{ch:verification_and_benchmark}

The verification process is divided into the two parts classification performance and throughput.
It ensures that all of the components perform as expected.

This chapter describes the verification process of the classification performance and the throughput of the \acrshort{cnn} models.
On the one hand, the classification performance of the floating-point and quantized models is assessed.
On the other hand, only the throughput of the quantized model on the embedded system is evaluated.
Additionally, the results of the verification process are listed and compared.
