\chapter{Project Goals}
\label{ch:project_goals}

The goal of project 5 and the thesis is to create an eye-catcher which demonstrates the engineering competences in FPGA and AI based design of the institute for sensors and electronics (ISE).
To achieve this, a throwing booth consisting of a camera, lighting, an FPGA development board and a monitor was built up in project 5.
During the thesis a system is to be implemented which captures the thrown object by the camera, classifies it on the FPGA by a CNN model and displays the result on the monitor.

The respective objectives for the thesis are specified in the table below.

	\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{L{1cm}|L{4cm}|X}
		\textbf{No.}	& \textbf{Objective}				& \textbf{Description} \\ \hline
		1.				& CNN Model							& The CNN model is developed and trained in Python 3 using TensorFlow 2 and the images collected in project 5. \\ \hline
		2.				& High-Performance Implementation	& The advantages of an FPGA flow into the development. Thus, special attention is paid to the performance of the system. \\ \hline
		3.				& Display							& A monitor displays the image of the object that was thrown. Furthermore, the guess of the CNN and the stats of the five most probably objects are shown. \\ \hline
		4.				& Verification						& The accuracy and performance of the CNN model implemented on the FPGA is verified and compared to the computer results.
