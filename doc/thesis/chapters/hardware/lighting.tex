\section{Lighting}
\label{sec:hardware:lighting}
The more light there is, the shorter the exposure time can be selected.
This results in a clearer image, which is an advantage in image recognition.
In order for the objects to be as independent of the lighting as possible, the lighting must not flicker and the field of view should be illuminated as uniformly as possible.
Therefore, diffuse lighting is required.
The SVL BAR LIGHT LHF300-WHI from Stemmer Imaging is used because it meets these requirements.
