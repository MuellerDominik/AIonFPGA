PYNQ is based on Ubuntu.
Because Baumer supports Ubuntu, the Baumer camera should work with this \acrlong{os}.
However, installing the official .deb package does not work.
The workaround is to use the installing package for a Rock64 board which Baumer distributed for a while.
A Rock64 development board consists of a Quad-Core ARM Cortex A53 processor just as the Ultrascale+ family.
Further mysqlclient and pq5 has to be installed to use the Baumer camera.

Although, both \acrshort{os} officially support wifi Petalinux has connecting problems due to a faulty root filesystem.

On PYNQ the \acrfull{apt} is installed.
This is the default package manager on most Debian distributions.
On Petalinux a recipe can be added as described in section \ref{subsec:embedded_platform:operating_systems:petalinux} to install and use a package manager.
