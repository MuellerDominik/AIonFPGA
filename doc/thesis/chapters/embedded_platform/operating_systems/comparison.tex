PYNQ is based on Ubuntu.
Since Baumer supports Ubuntu, the Baumer camera should work with this \acrlong{os}.
However, the installation of the official \texttt{.deb} package does not work.
% The workaround is to use the installation package for the Rock64 board that Baumer distributed for a while.
The workaround is to use the installation package for the Rock64 board that Baumer distributed for a while in the past.
The Rock64 development board features a quad-core ARM Cortex A53 processor like the UltraScale+ family.
% In addition mysqlclient and pq5 have to be installed to use the Baumer camera.
Additionally, \texttt{mysqlclient} and \texttt{pq5} must be installed to use the Baumer camera.

Although both \acrlongpl{os} officially support Wi-Fi, PetaLinux has connecting problems due to a faulty root filesystem.

On PYNQ the \acrfull{apt} is installed.
This is the default package manager on most Debian-based distributions.
On PetaLinux, a recipe can be added to install and use a package manager, as described in section \ref{subsec:embedded_platform:operating_systems:petalinux}.
