\section{\acrshort{mpsoc} Block Diagram}
\label{sec:embedded_platform:block_diagram}

Figure \ref{fig:hardware_overview} shows the most important hardware components for this project on the Ultra96-V2 board.
The communication and data shifting is handled by the interconnects, on the \acrlong{pl} side it is the AXI Interconnect \cite{mpsoc_memory}.
Recorded frames are stored in the \acrshort{ram} and retrieved when needed.
The Mali-400 MP2 is an OpenGL multi core \acrfull{gpu} distributed by ARM \cite{arm_mali}.
A \acrshort{gpu} is needed to run the graphical interface.
The \acrshort{pl} contains the \acrshort{dpu} to run the inference.
The application and the operating system run on the ARM processor.
