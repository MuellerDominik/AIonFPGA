\section{Artificial Intelligence}
\label{sec:theoretical_background:ai}

The field of \acrlong{ai} is a branch of computer science that aims to understand and build intelligent agent.
An agent is an entity that perceives its environment through sensors and acts upon it through actuators.
How well an agent performs in its environment is assessed by a performance measure.
A rational agent selects actions which are expected to maximize its performance measure \cite[p.~1--37]{ai}.
